# Problem Statement
Building a system for Titanic Survival Prediction.

# Titanic Survival Prediction
The Titanic was known as the unsinkable ship ans was the most luxurious and largest ship of that time. The ship sank after being hitted by a huge iceberg killing over more then 1500 people. However theie were certain people who survived. The one's who survived belonged to a particular class of society i.e. only rich and popular people were saved.
In this project, we analyze the Titanic dataset set obtained from kaggle and will make two prediction. One prediction to see which passengers on board the ship would survive and then another prediction to see if we would have survived if were on board.<br>
After analyzing the dataset, it has been noticed that the passengers who purchased tickets of class A and with maximum fares survived the most. We have done visualization of each and every parameter to check the survival rate.<br>
We split the data into train data and test data in the ratio 80:20 i.e. 80% train data and 20% test data. We used different machine learning models to make our predictions. The algorithms are: Logistic Regression algorithm, KNN algorithm, Support Vector Machine algorithm, Kernel SVM algorithm, Naive Bayes algorithm, Decision Tree algorithm and Random Forest algorithm. Confusion matrix is shown and accuracy is checked and the model which was most accurate was Logistic Regression Model with an accuracy of 81.1%.

# Conclusion
The model that I use to make prediction for which passenger on board the ship would survive and then another prediction to see if i would have survived, is Random Forest Classifier because it has 78.50% testing accuracy and 98.79% training accuracy. Now we have chosen a model for making the predictions, so we see if i would i have survived or not. After putting the values, it looks like i would have not survived.
